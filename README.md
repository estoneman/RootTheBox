# COMP 352/452: Introduction to Computer Vulnerabilities
## Fall 2021 Project
The goal of this assignment is to exploit a **badly secured** server and **badly written** piece of code to gain root (administrator) access on a system.
You will be provided with an IP address. Use everything you learned in class.
Make sure you provide enough screenshots so that I can replicate what you did. Failure to do so will result in lost points.

### Happy hacking!
